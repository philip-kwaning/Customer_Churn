## Customer Churn Analysis Project
Every company wants to increase its profit or revenue margin and customer retention is one key area industry players focus their resources. This project focuses on whether a customer will churn or not.

## **Overview**
The goal of this project is to analyze and comprehend customer churn in a company. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is an important indicator that has a direct impact on the profitability and growth of a firm. I hope to discover patterns, key drivers, and potential indications of customer churn by using data analytics and machine learning approaches. This analysis' findings will help to influence strategic decisions and allow for the implementation of focused retention measures.


### Analysis Highlights
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
* Hypothesis testing on contract terms and payment methods.
* Evaluation of various machine learning models.
* Balancing the dataset using SMOTE.
* Feature selection and importance analysis.
* ROC Curve analysis and threshold tuning.


## Hypothesis:

H0: Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.

H1: The tenure of customers has no significant impact on churn.

## Analytical Questions

1. What is the overall churn rate in the dataset?

2. Which InternetService type (DSL, Fiber optic) has the highest churn rate?

3. What is the distribution of customers based on gender, senior citizen status, partner, and dependents?

4. Is there a significant difference in churn rates between customers with month-to-month contracts and those with longer-term contracts?

5. Are there specific payment methods associated with higher or lower churn?

6. Among customers with DSL and fiber optic internet, which group has a higher churn rate?

7. How does the provision of phone service (True/False) influence customer churn?

## Project Structure:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The project begins with the collection of relevant data, including customer gender, dependancy, support interactions, Phone Service and any other pertinent information. This data will serve as the foundation for our analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis is a crucial step. This involves handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data quality.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - EDA involves exploring the data to identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations. Visualization tools may be employed to gain a preliminary understanding of the dataset.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identify key features like tenure and internet service influence customer churn. 

5. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Common algorithms like logistic regression, and  decision trees were implemented, evaluated and selected the most suitable model based on performance metrics.

6. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Thorough investigation to understand the root causes of customer churn must be done. This may involve surveys, interviews with departing customers, and an in-depth analysis of customer service data.

7. **Implementation of Retention Strategies:**
    -  Based on the insights gained from the analysis retention strategies must be developed and implemented. This may include personalized communication, enhanced customer experience initiatives, and tailored incentives.


## Dependencies:
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
